# 🚀 New Release and Deployment Workflow

## 📋 System Summary

This system offers **total control** over when to deploy to production, while maintaining automatic versioning for control and history.

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### 1. **Development** → Feature branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-functionality
# ... code ...
npm run commit  # Conventional commit
git push origin feature/new-functionality
```

### 2. **Pull Request** → Create PR to `master`

### 3. **Merge PR** → **Tag `v*` automatically created**
- Semantic Release analyzes commits
- Determines new version
- Automatically creates tag `v1.2.0`

### 4. **Staging** → Automatic deployment for testing

### 5. **Production** → **Manual deployment when you want**
```bash
git tag prod/v1.2.0
git push origin prod/v1.2.0
```

## 🎯 Tag Types

### Automatic Tags (`v*`)
- **Created by**: Semantic Release automatically
- **When**: PRs are merged to master
- **Purpose**: Version control and history
- **Examples**: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v1.0.1`

### Production Tags (`prod/v*`)
- **Created by**: Developers manually
- **When**: When they want to deploy to production
- **Purpose**: Trigger for production deployment
- **Examples**: `prod/v1.0.0`, `prod/v1.1.0`, `prod/v1.0.1`

## 🚀 New System Advantages

### ✅ **Total Control**
- Production deployment **only happens when you want**
- Staging always updated for testing
- Automatic versioning for control

### ✅ **Flexibility**
- Can deploy old versions
- Can skip versions if necessary
- Can deploy the same version multiple times

### ✅ **Security**
- Nothing goes to production without your permission
- Staging always tested first
- Complete version history

## 📋 Practical Example

### Scenario: New login functionality

```bash
# 1. Development
git checkout -b feature/login-system
# ... implement login ...
npm run commit  # feat: add login system
git push origin feature/login-system

# 2. Pull Request
# Create PR on GitHub
# Code review and approval

# 3. Merge PR
# PR is merged to master

# 4. Automatic result:
# - Tag v1.1.0 automatically created
# - Staging deployment executed
# - Application available for testing

# 5. Production deployment (when you want):
git tag prod/v1.1.0
git push origin prod/v1.1.0
# Production deployment executed automatically
```

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check created tags:
```bash
# Automatic tags
git tag --list "v*"

# Production tags
git tag --list "prod/v*"

# See details
git show v1.1.0
git show prod/v1.1.0
```

### Check workflows:
1. GitHub → Actions
2. Check executed workflows:
   - `Deploy to Staging (Master Branch)`
   - `Auto Release on PR Merge`
   - `Deploy to Production (Manual Release)`

## ⚠️ Important Points

1. **Tags `v*` are created automatically** - don't create manually
2. **Tags `prod/v*` are created manually** - only when you want to deploy
3. **PRs must be MERGED**, not just closed
4. **Staging always updated** for testing
5. **Production under your total control**

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Tag `v*` was not created:
- Verify if PR was merged (not closed)
- Verify if commits follow conventions
- Check release workflow logs

### Production deployment did not execute:
- Verify if tag `prod/v*` was created
- Check production workflow logs
- Verify if secrets are configured

## 🎉 Final Result

With this system you have:

- ✅ **Automatic versioning** for control
- ✅ **Staging always updated** for testing
- ✅ **Total control over production** - only deploys when you want
- ✅ **Complete history** of all versions
- ✅ **Security** - nothing goes to production without permission

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the system** by creating a PR and merging
2. **Verify** if tag `v*` was automatically created
3. **Test production deployment** by creating a `prod/v*` tag
4. **Monitor** workflows in the GitHub Actions tab

The system is configured and working! 🎯
